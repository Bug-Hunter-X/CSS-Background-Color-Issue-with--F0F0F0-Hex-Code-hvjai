This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue in CSS where the background color of a div element refuses to apply when using the hexadecimal color code #F0F0F0.  All other color codes, including other light grays, seem to work as expected. The bug.css file showcases the problem, and bugSolution.css offers a potential workaround.  The issue appears to be specific to this particular hex code and browser compatibility might be a factor. Further investigation may be required to determine the root cause.
